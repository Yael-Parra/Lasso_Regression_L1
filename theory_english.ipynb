    "Lasso regression is a statistical technique used in machine learning to improve the accuracy of predictive models, especially when working with large datasets. Its main goal is to prevent overfitting, a problem that occurs when a model fits the training data too closely and does not perform well on new data. Lasso achieves this by applying a penalty that reduces the magnitude of the coefficients of the predictor variables, even forcing some to zero. This simplifies the model, automatically selects the most important variables, and improves its generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>\n",
    "Clarification:\n",
    "Although Lasso regression and L1 regularization are often mentioned as if they were the same, they are not actually. Lasso is a regression model that uses L1 penalization, but L1 regularization is also used in other models beyond regression, such as in logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), neural networks, and feature selection in linear models. The confusion arises because Lasso is the most common example of L1 regularization, leading many sources to treat them as synonyms. </i>\n",

    "### <span style=\"color:#ffc509\"> What is **regularization?** </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, regularization is like putting a brake on the model so it doesn't become too complicated. The problem is that sometimes the model memorizes the training data, like a student who memorizes exact answers for an exam. This is called \"overfitting.\" When this happens, the model performs poorly on new data. Regularization adds a \"penalty\" to the formula that the model uses to know when it's wrong, so that it learns more generally, and not so specifically, and in this way, it doesn't memorize the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <span style=\"color:#ffc509\"> **What** is Lasso regression? </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso regression, also known as L1 regularization, is a type of linear regression that adds a penalty based on the absolute value of the coefficients of the predictor variables. This penalty forces some coefficients to be exactly zero, which means those variables are eliminated from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <span style=\"color:#ffc509\"> **Why** is Lasso regression used? </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prevention of overfitting: Reduces the complexity of the model, preventing it from fitting the training data too closely.\n",
    "- Automatic variable selection: Identifies and retains only the most relevant variables for prediction, simplifying the model and improving its interpretability.\n",
    "- Handling multicollinearity: Although it does not eliminate it completely, Lasso can mitigate the effects of multicollinearity (high correlation between predictor variables) by selecting one variable and eliminating the correlated ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### <span style=\"color:#ffc509\">  **How** does LASSO regression work? </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  L1 Penalty: Lasso adds a penalty term to the cost function of the linear regression model. This term is proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of the predictor variables.\n",
    "2. Lambda Parameter (λ): This parameter controls the strength of the penalty.\n",
    "    - A high λ increases the penalty, which reduces more coefficients to zero, simplifying the model.\n",
    "    - A low λ decreases the penalty, retaining more variables in the model.\n",
    "3. Minimization of Mean Squared Error (MSE): Lasso seeks the value of the coefficients that minimizes the MSE (the difference between the predicted and actual values), subject to the L1 penalty.\n",
    "4. Variable Selection: By forcing some coefficients to zero, Lasso performs automatic variable selection, keeping only the most important ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function that LASSO regression tries to minimize is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ J(\\beta) = \\text{Error} + \\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^{p} |\\beta_i| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $J(\\beta)$ is the cost function.\n",
    "* $\\text{Error}$ is a measure of the error between the predicted values and the actual values (for example, the sum of squared errors in standard linear regression).\n",
    "* $\\lambda$ (lambda) is the **regularization parameter** (a hyperparameter that is tuned). It controls the strength of the penalty. The higher the value of $\\lambda$, the greater the penalty.\n",
    "* $\\sum_{i=1}^{p} |\\beta_i|$ is the **L1 norm** of the coefficients, which is the sum of the absolute values of all the coefficients ($\\beta_i$).\n",
    "* $p$ is the number of predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <span style=\"color:#ffc509\">  **When** is Lasso regression used? </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "- High-dimensional datasets: When there are many more predictor variables than observations.\n",
    "- Automatic variable selection: When it is necessary to identify the most relevant variables for prediction.\n",
    "- Predictive problems: Where the main objective is prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <span style=\"color:#ffc509\">  **The key to LASSO regression: Feature selection** </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "The main distinguishing feature of L1 regularization (and therefore LASSO regression) is its ability to **force some of the coefficients of the predictor variables to be exactly zero**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When $\\lambda$ is sufficiently large, the L1 penalty can cause the coefficients of the less important variables to be reduced to zero, effectively eliminating those variables from the model.\n",
    "* This makes LASSO regression a useful method for **feature selection**, as it automatically identifies the most relevant variables for prediction.\n",
    "* The resulting model is more **parsimonious** (has fewer variables) and, therefore, often easier to interpret.\n",

    "\n",
    "### <span style=\"color:#ffc509\">  **Advantages** of LASSO regression: </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automatic feature selection: Identifies and eliminates irrelevant variables, simplifying the model and making it easier to interpret. For example, when predicting the price of a house, LASSO selects the most relevant features such as size and location.\n",
    "* Helps prevent overfitting: Reduces the complexity of the model by penalizing large coefficients, which improves accuracy on new data.\n",
    "* Useful in high-dimensional datasets: Works well when there are many predictor variables (high dimension), some of which may be irrelevant.\n",
    "* Improves model interpretability: By having fewer variables, the model is easier to understand and explain.\n",
    "* Can handle some multicollinearity: Tends to select one variable from a group of highly correlated variables and set the coefficients of the others to zero. For example, if you have variables like \"square meters\" and \"number of rooms,\" LASSO selects the most important one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <span style=\"color:#ffc509\">  **Disadvantages** of LASSO regression: </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "* May discard relevant variables: If $\\lambda$ is too large, it could eliminate variables that actually have an impact on the prediction, which would reduce the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "* Arbitrary selection in high multicollinearity: If there are groups of highly correlated variables, LASSO may select one of them arbitrarily (randomly), which can be unstable, as small variations in the data could change the selected variable.\n",
    "* May not perform as well as Ridge if all variables are relevant: If most variables have some impact on the prediction, Ridge regression might give better results in terms of predictive accuracy.\n",
    "* The choice of the parameter $\\lambda$ is crucial: An incorrect value of $\\lambda$ can lead to an underfitted model (if $\\lambda$ is too large) or an overfitted model (if $\\lambda$ is too small). The optimal selection of $\\lambda$ is often done using cross-validation techniques.\n",
